A game show hosted by the famous anchor Suma in which the celebrities compete 
with each other. The game show format is changed a bit, There are N celebrities 
participated now. And all of them answered correctly for a given question.
Now everyone got a chance to play the money board game.
Where i-th player standing at i-th index position of the top, 
and value of 'i' is 0 <= i < n.

The money board is of size M*N, and N players has coins to drop from
top of the money board. The money board is opened at top and bottom.

Each cell in the board has a diagonal bar connecting two corners of the cell,
that can redirect the coin to the rightside or to the leftside.

- The bar that redirects the coin to the right, 
connected from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner, indicated by 1.
- The bar that redirects the coin to the left, 
connected from the top-right corner to the bottom-left corner, indicated by -1.

The players drop their coins at the top of board. Each coin can get stuck 
in the board or fall out of the bottom. A coin gets stuck if it hits a "V" 
shaped pattern between two bars or if a bar redirects the coin into 
either wall of the board.

Your task is to find and return an array result[] of size N,
where result[i] is the index that the coin falls out of at the bottom 
after dropping the coin from the i-th index at the top, 
or -1 if the coin gets stuck in the board.

Input Format:
-------------
Line-1: Two space separated integer M and N, size of the board.
Next M lines: N space separated integers

Output Format:
--------------
Print an array result. 


Sample Input-1:
---------------
5 5
1 1 1 -1 -1
-1 -1 -1 1 -1
1 1 1 1 -1
-1 -1 -1 -1 1
-1 -1 -1 1 -1

Sample Output-1:
----------------
[-1, 0, -1, -1, -1]


Sample Input-2:
---------------
5 5
1 1 1 1 1
-1 -1 -1 -1 -1
1 1 1 1 1
-1 -1 -1 -1 -1
1 1 1 1 1

Sample Output-2:
----------------
[1, 2, 3, 4, -1]
